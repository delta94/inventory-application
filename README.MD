## Description

This is part of The Odin Project's NodeJS course. In this app, the users can navigate through categories and look at items which they can update or delete (with a password) or create new ones.

It was built with:

-   **NodeJS** with the **Express** framework.
-   **MongoDB** for the database using **mongoose**.
-   **Handlebars** as an HTML template engine.

I learned how to use some libraries like **multer** for image uploading and **express-validator** to validate and sanitize incoming data.
