### Basic Inventory App with CRUD actions

This is part of The Odin Project's NodeJS course. In this app, the users can navigate through categories and look at items which they can update or delete (with a password) or create new ones.

It was built with:

-   **NodeJS** with the **Express** framework.
-   **MongoDB** for the database using **mongoose**.
-   **Handlebars** as an HTML template engine.

I learned how to use some libraries like **multer** for image uploading and **express-validator** to validate and sanitize incoming data.
